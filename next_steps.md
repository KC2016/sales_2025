## Customer-Focused Analysis
**Customer Segmentation:** This analysis breaks down your customer base into groups based on shared characteristics. A common method is RFM analysis (Recency, Frequency, Monetary), which groups customers by how recently they bought, how often they buy, and how much they spend. This helps you target your most valuable customers.

**Customer Lifetime Value (CLV):** This measures the total revenue a business can expect from a single customer throughout their entire relationship. By calculating CLV, you can identify your most profitable customers and allocate marketing spend more effectively.

### Data (MOOC) for ccustomer-Focused Analysis
1. For RFM & CLV Analysis
These fields are crucial for understanding a user's value and loyalty.

`enrollment_date`: The date the user enrolled in their first course. This helps calculate Recency.

`total_courses_enrolled`: The total number of courses a user has enrolled in. This helps calculate Frequency.

`total_revenue`: The total amount of money a user has spent on courses. This is essential for Monetary value and Customer Lifetime Value (CLV).

| Column Name | Data Type | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `enrollment_date` | DATE | The date the user enrolled in their first course. |
| `total_courses_enrolled` | NUMBER | The total number of courses a user has enrolled in. |
| `total_revenue` | NUMBER | The total amount of money a user has spent on courses. |


2. For Behavioral Segmentation
These columns help you understand how users interact with your content.

`total_time_watched_minutes`: The total video watch time for each user. This is a great proxy for engagement.

`video_completion_rate`: The percentage of videos a user completes. You can create this by calculating the percentage of videos watched to the total number of videos in an enrolled course.

`quiz_score_average`: The average score a user achieves on quizzes. This is a strong indicator of user engagement and learning success.

| Column Name | Data Type | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `total_time_watched_minutes` | NUMBER | The total video watch time for each user in minutes. |
| `video_completion_rate` | NUMBER | The percentage of videos a user completes. |
| `quiz_score_average` | NUMBER | The average score a user achieves on quizzes. |


3. For Demographic & Psychographic Segmentation
These fields help you understand who your users are.

`user_occupation`: The user's job or field of study. This helps you identify which professions are most interested in your courses.

`user_age_group`: A categorical field for age (e.g., 18-24, 25-34). This is better for analysis than a raw age number.

`referral_channel`: How the user found your platform (e.g., Organic Search, Social Media, Paid Ad).

| Column Name | Data Type | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `user_occupation` | TEXT / VARCHAR | The user's job or field of study. |
| `user_age_group` | TEXT / VARCHAR | A categorical field for age. |
| `referral_channel` | TEXT / VARCHAR | How the user found your platform. |


## Product and Performance Analysis
**Product Performance and Mix:** Go beyond just knowing your top-selling products. Analyze your product mix to see what categories are selling together. You can also identify your laggards—products that aren't selling well—and decide whether to discontinue or promote them.

**Cross-Selling and Upselling:** This analysis identifies products that are often purchased together. For example, if customers who buy laptops also frequently buy a specific brand of mouse, you can create targeted promotions to increase sales.

## Efficiency and Strategic Analysis
**Channel Performance Analysis:** If your sales data includes the channel (e.g., website, social media, in-store), you can analyze which channels are driving the most revenue, transactions, and profitability.

**Geographic Hot Spots:** You've already analyzed sales by region. You can take this a step further by using a map to visualize your sales distribution and identify specific high-performing "hot spots" within a country or city.




## Analyse Funnels

Creating a hypothetical MOOC dataset is an excellent way to practice advanced analysis like funnels, which require event-based data. It's a great skill to have.

To perform a funnel analysis, your dataset needs to track user actions over time. Here's a professional schema for a hypothetical MOOC dataset, designed specifically for this kind of analysis.

### Core Dataset Schema
This table structure allows you to track a user's journey from initial sign-up to course completion. You can create this data in a simple CSV file or by writing a short script in Python.

| Column Name | Data Type | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **user_id** | TEXT / VARCHAR | A unique identifier for each user. |
| **event_timestamp** | TIMESTAMP | The date and time of the user's action. |
| **event_type** | TEXT / VARCHAR | Records each stage of the user's journey. |
| **course_id** | TEXT / VARCHAR | A unique identifier for the course. |
| **user_country** | TEXT / VARCHAR | The user's country. |
| **referral_source** | TEXT / VARCHAR | How the user found the course. |


How the user found the course (e.g., google_ads, social_media, blog_post).

How to Use This Data for a Funnel Analysis
With this dataset, you can perform a funnel analysis by counting the number of users at each event_type and calculating the conversion rate between them.

For example, your funnel stages would be:

1. **Signed Up:** Count of all unique user_ids with an event_type of signed_up.

2. **Enrolled:** Count of all unique user_ids with an event_type of enrolled_in_course.

3. **Completed:** Count of all unique user_ids with an event_type of completed_course.

I would then calculate the conversion rate from one stage to the next (e.g., % of users who enrolled = (Enrolled Count / Signed Up Count) * 100).

### Other Analyses I Can Do
This dataset is versatile and allows for other valuable insights:

**Geographic Segmentation:** Analyze conversion rates by user_country to see where your marketing is most effective.

**Source Analysis:** Determine which referral_source brings in the most valuable users (those who complete courses).

**Time-to-Completion:** Calculate the average time it takes for a user to complete a course from the enrollment date.
